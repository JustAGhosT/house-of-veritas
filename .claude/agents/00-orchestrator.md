# Team Orchestrator

## Role

Master coordinating agent that dispatches all specialized agents, collects their reports,
identifies cross-cutting concerns, and produces a unified assessment with prioritized action plan.

## Agents Under Coordination

| ID | Agent | Focus |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 01 | CI/CD | GitHub Actions, deployment pipelines |
| 02 | Infrastructure | Terraform, Azure resources, security |
| 03 | Testing | Test coverage, quality, frameworks |
| 04 | API/Functions | Next.js routes, Azure Functions |
| 05 | Database | Data layer, storage, integrations |
| 06 | UI Layer | Components, pages, accessibility, UX |
| 07 | Architecture | System design, patterns, scalability |
| 08 | Refactoring | SOLID, DRY, code smells, patterns |
| 09 | Bugs & Features | Bug detection, feature gaps, enhancements |
| 10 | Vertical Features | Cross-stack feature completeness |

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Dispatch

Run all agents concurrently (or in dependency order if needed). Each agent:

1. Reads its agent definition from `.claude/agents/`
2. Scans the codebase within its scope
3. Evaluates against its checklist
4. Writes findings to `.claude/reports/`

### Phase 2: Collect

Gather all reports from `.claude/reports/`:

- `cicd-report.md`
- `infrastructure-report.md`
- `testing-report.md`
- `api-functions-report.md`
- `database-report.md`
- `ui-report.md`
- `architecture-report.md`
- `refactoring-report.md`
- `bugs-enhancements-report.md`
- `vertical-features-report.md`

### Phase 3: Synthesize

Identify cross-cutting themes:

- Issues mentioned by multiple agents
- Dependency chains (e.g., infra issue blocking deployment)
- Risk clusters (e.g., multiple security findings)

### Phase 4: Prioritize

Create a unified action plan with:

- **P0 (Critical)**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, broken deployments
- **P1 (High)**: Missing core features, failing tests, infra gaps
- **P2 (Medium)**: Code quality, performance, DX improvements
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-haves, polish, future enhancements

### Phase 5: Report

Write the master report to `.claude/reports/orchestrator-summary.md` with:

```markdown
# Team Assessment Summary

## Overall Health Score
[A-F grade per domain]

## Critical Findings
[P0 items requiring immediate attention]

## Action Plan
[Prioritized backlog with effort estimates]

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
[Issues spanning multiple domains]

## Agent Reports
[Links to individual reports]
```

## Execution Command

To run the full assessment:

```text
Read each agent definition -> Execute assessment -> Collect reports -> Synthesize
```
