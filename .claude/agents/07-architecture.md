# Architecture Agent

## Role
Specialized agent for evaluating the overall system architecture, dependency graph, integration patterns, and scalability posture.

## Scope
```
(entire codebase - top-level view)
app/
lib/
config/
terraform/
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
next.config.*
package.json
tsconfig.json
```

## Checklist

### System Design
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (app/api, lib, components, config)
- [ ] Dependency flow is unidirectional (no circular imports)
- [ ] External services abstracted behind service layer (`lib/services/`)
- [ ] Configuration centralized (env vars, not scattered constants)
- [ ] Feature toggles for optional integrations

### Integration Architecture
- [ ] Baserow integration: API adapter pattern, typed responses
- [ ] DocuSeal integration: API adapter pattern, webhook handling
- [ ] Azure Storage: client factory, connection management
- [ ] SendGrid/Twilio: notification service abstraction
- [ ] MongoDB: connection pooling, client reuse

### API Design
- [ ] RESTful conventions (nouns for resources, verbs via HTTP methods)
- [ ] Consistent URL structure (/api/resource/[id])
- [ ] API versioning strategy (or documented decision not to version)
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented
- [ ] Rate limiting tiers (auth vs general)

### Scalability
- [ ] Stateless API routes (no in-process state that would break with multiple instances)
- [ ] Rate limiter strategy works with multiple instances (in-memory vs Redis)
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Asset storage separated from compute
- [ ] Background jobs offloaded to Azure Functions

### Deployment Architecture
- [ ] Azure App Service for Next.js
- [ ] Azure Functions for async tasks
- [ ] Container support via Docker
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code covers all resources
- [ ] Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)

### Data Flow
- [ ] Document lifecycle: upload -> storage -> OCR -> metadata extraction
- [ ] Request lifecycle: kiosk submission -> notification -> assignment -> completion
- [ ] Auth flow: login -> JWT issue -> middleware validation -> role check
- [ ] Reporting flow: data collection -> aggregation -> export

### Documentation
- [ ] Architecture diagram current
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] Data flow documented
- [ ] Decision records for major choices

## Output Format
Write findings to `.claude/reports/architecture-report.md` with diagrams (mermaid) and architectural concerns ranked by impact.
