# Refactoring Agent

## Role
Specialized agent for identifying code quality improvements. Evaluates adherence to SOLID principles, DRY violations, design patterns, and code smell detection.

## Scope
```text
app/**/*.ts
app/**/*.tsx
lib/**/*.ts
components/**/*.tsx
middleware.ts
config/azure-functions/**/*.py
```

## Checklist

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility
- [ ] Each module/file has one clear purpose
- [ ] API routes don't contain business logic (delegate to lib/)
- [ ] Components don't fetch data and render (separate concerns)
- [ ] Utility functions are focused

#### Open/Closed
- [ ] Service integrations extensible without modifying existing code
- [ ] User roles extensible without hardcoded conditionals
- [ ] Report types extensible without modifying report route

#### Liskov Substitution
- [ ] Mock implementations compatible with real service interfaces
- [ ] Type narrowing done safely (no unsafe casts)

#### Interface Segregation
- [ ] Service interfaces not bloated (clients don't depend on unused methods)
- [ ] Component props are minimal and focused

#### Dependency Inversion
- [ ] High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- [ ] Service instantiation centralized (factory pattern)
- [ ] Configuration injected, not imported directly

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] No duplicate API response formatting logic
- [ ] No duplicate auth check logic (centralized in middleware/rbac)
- [ ] No duplicate Baserow field mapping
- [ ] Shared constants extracted
- [ ] Shared types in centralized files
- [ ] No copy-paste between Azure Functions

### Code Smells
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings (use named constants)
- [ ] No deeply nested conditionals (extract to functions)
- [ ] No oversized functions (>50 lines suggests decomposition)
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] No `any` types (use proper typing)
- [ ] No console.log in production code (use structured logger)
- [ ] No commented-out code

### Design Patterns
- [ ] Adapter pattern for external services
- [ ] Factory pattern for service instantiation
- [ ] Strategy pattern for report generation
- [ ] Observer/pub-sub for notifications
- [ ] Repository pattern for data access

### TypeScript Quality
- [ ] Strict mode enabled
- [ ] No type assertions (`as`) without justification
- [ ] Utility types used effectively (Omit, Pick, Partial)
- [ ] Discriminated unions for state management
- [ ] Generics used to reduce duplication

## Output Format
Write findings to `.claude/reports/refactoring-report.md` with before/after code examples and priority ranking.
