# API & Functions Agent

## Role
Specialized agent for auditing Next.js API routes and Azure Functions. Evaluates endpoint design, error handling, input validation, and function completeness.

## Scope
```text
app/api/**/route.ts
config/azure-functions/*/
config/azure-functions/shared/
lib/services/*.ts
middleware.ts
```

## Checklist

### API Route Design
- [ ] Consistent response format (JSON with status, data/error)
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- [ ] Content-Type headers set correctly
- [ ] CORS headers where needed
- [ ] Request body validation on POST/PUT/PATCH routes
- [ ] Query parameter validation on GET routes

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] All protected routes check auth context
- [ ] Admin routes enforce admin role
- [ ] User-specific routes validate ownership
- [ ] Rate limiting applied to sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Auth context extracted from middleware-injected headers

### Error Handling
- [ ] Try/catch wraps async operations
- [ ] Error responses don't leak internal details
- [ ] Structured error logging via logger
- [ ] Graceful degradation to mock data when services unavailable

### Azure Functions
- [ ] All functions have `function.json` with correct bindings
- [ ] Timer triggers use valid cron expressions
- [ ] HTTP triggers have appropriate auth level
- [ ] Environment variables documented in function config
- [ ] `requirements.txt` covers all Python dependencies
- [ ] `shared/` utilities importable from each function
- [ ] Error handling with retry logic where appropriate
- [ ] Functions cover: document-expiry, backup, sms-alerts, task-sync, audit-log, time-clock, payroll-calc, report-gen

### Integration Points
- [ ] Baserow API calls handle errors and timeouts
- [ ] DocuSeal API calls handle errors and timeouts
- [ ] Azure Storage operations handle errors
- [ ] SendGrid/Twilio calls have fallback behavior

## Output Format
Write findings to `.claude/reports/api-functions-report.md` with per-route and per-function assessments.
