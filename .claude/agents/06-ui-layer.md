# UI Layer Agent

## Role

Specialized agent for auditing the frontend: React components, pages, layouts, styling, accessibility, and UX patterns.

## Scope

```text
app/**/page.tsx
app/**/layout.tsx
components/**/*.tsx
public/
styles/
tailwind.config.*
next.config.*
```

## Checklist

### Component Architecture

- [ ] Components are single-responsibility
- [ ] Props interfaces defined with TypeScript
- [ ] Reusable components extracted (buttons, cards, forms)
- [ ] Client vs Server components marked correctly (`"use client"`)
- [ ] No prop drilling beyond 2 levels (use context or composition)

### Page Completeness

- [ ] Login page renders and handles form submission
- [ ] Kiosk page functional for public requests
- [ ] Each user dashboard (admin, operator-1, operator-2, resident) has unique content
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows aggregated data
- [ ] Navigation links work and indicate active route
- [ ] 404 / error pages styled

### Styling & Design

- [ ] Tailwind classes consistent (no mixing utility CSS with custom CSS)
- [ ] Dark mode support via CSS variables or Tailwind dark: prefix
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Typography hierarchy (h1-h6, body, caption)
- [ ] Color palette consistent across components
- [ ] Loading states (skeletons or spinners)
- [ ] Empty states (no data messages)

### Accessibility

- [ ] Form labels associated with inputs
- [ ] ARIA labels on interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Focus management on modals/dialogs
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- [ ] Alt text on images

### Performance

- [ ] Images use next/image for optimization
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (memoization where needed)
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable (check for large dependencies)

### State Management

- [ ] Form state handled consistently (controlled components)
- [ ] Server state fetched via API routes
- [ ] Optimistic updates where appropriate
- [ ] Error states displayed to users
- [ ] Loading states during data fetches

### PWA

- [ ] Service worker registered
